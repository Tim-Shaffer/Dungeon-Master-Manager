Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game that allows players to embark on a campaign with fellow adventurers led by the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master is the narrator of the campaign as well as the architect of the adventure. Players have switched to a digital version of the game and this App is aimed to assist the Dungeon Master (DM).  The App will assist the DM in managing the campaign. It will help keep track of player stats, dice rolls and other various data.
